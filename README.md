Next players will then take turn rolling dice, upon landing on a untaken property. Player will have the option to purchase or choose not to purchase by skipping.
Should they choose to purchase the property, the tile will change to the player's color.
Property price and rent increases in clock-wise direction starting from GO position. This is where players can consider to skip buying property to plan their play.
This is due to the fact the rent would increase as the round advances (this function not implemented yet )
